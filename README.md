# nyanya8

a chip-8 emulator i hacked together in c++/sdl over a few summer days for fun and learning  
there is no sound as of now and i don't think i'll be adding it :( maybe one day...  
other than that i think it's pretty functional but on the other hand there surely are some better ones out there  
also there are a couple useful roms bundled for testing  

### build  
get sdl2 and choose a rom by editing line 19 of main.cpp and then just  
```
g++ main.cpp -lSDL2 -o chip8
```

### status
- i think all the opcodes work  
- may freeze or break or
- no gui no sound no save states
- probably abandoned
